## Foundations Highlights

### Class Coercion (Chapter 3)

When you combine multiple vector types of different classes, there are pre-determined rules for which class "wins" (i.e., which class both inputs will be coerced to automatically prior to combination). This order (from most specific to most general) is: 

```{r class-coercion-order}
#| eval: false

logical > integer > double (~numeric) > character
```

Other vector classes are secretly built on one of these four and are treated as such for class coercion purposes.

- Factor = actually an integer
- Date = actually a double/numeric (**days** since January 1^st^, 1970)
- Date-times = actually a double/numeric (**seconds** since January 1^st^, 1970)
- Duration = actually a double/numeric (units dependent on dates/date-times and stored in vector attributes)

_See [3.2.4](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#testing-and-coercion) and [3.4](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#s3-atomic-vectors) for more information._

### `[`, `[[`, and `$` (Chapter 4)

If `x` is a train with multiple cars and each car contains multiple items:

- `x[1]` grabs the whole first train car
- `x[[1]]` grabs the _contents of_ the whole first train car
- `x$1` is shorthand for `x[[1]]`

`[[` versus `$`

If `name` is an object containing one of the names in `x`,

- `x[[name]]` will get the entity that matches the _value_ of `name`
- `x$name` will get an entity that _is itself named_ `name`
