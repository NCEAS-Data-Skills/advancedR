## Notes

Note taker: Nick Lyon

**Review Concepts & Questions from Chapter 5 & 6**

- Reviewed agenda indicated by Rachel above
- General feeling that not all exercises are equally valuable
    - Perhaps approach the book / this group differently to avoid parts that don't feel valuable to us?
- Not everyone got through chapter 6 and general consensus that it wasn't super valuable
- Chapter 5 was well-received by people
    - Good to review difference between `if` + `else` & `ifelse`
- Good to know that despite `y <- if (x) 3` working, it's still opaque/not best practice
- Generally nice to have the affirmation that it's important to carefully consider (and control) input and output types/classes
- `repeat` was new to some of us
- `switch` was new to some of us
- argument name partial string matching was a worrisome behavior
- Use cases not always clear especially for chapter 6
- Chapter 6 did drive home the importance of argument defaults and informative argument names
- Bizarre edge cases are useful for learning why certain things are done the way they are
    - E.g., why you should use `return()` in functions, etc.
- Helped clarify some people's earlier experiences with convoluted code
- Serious package maintainers / developers would likely benefit from some of more niche/specific exercises and/or topics in function 6
- Some exercises seemed misaligned from book content (or at least could have been better aligned)
- Prefix functions "play nicer" with Tidyverse-style pipes than the other function forms
- Looking forward to next section (starting at chapter 9) "functional programming"

**Plan for Next Time**

- Try chapter 7 (Environments) _and_ chapter 8 (Conditions) or just one?
    - Consensus to do just one chapter
    - Doing just Chapter 7

**Other Topics**

- Nick edited the repo to support local previewing of a Quarto website
- Can add your notes to `_quarto.yml`
- See the website with `quarto preview` in the Terminal
