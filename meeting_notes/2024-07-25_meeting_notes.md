## Notes

### Structure Ideas

- Use group time to read and work through chapters together 

- Individually read chapter before hand and do exercises together (as large group or in pairs, depending on size of large group)

- Read chapter and try exercises beforehand, use group time to discuss challenging issues or confusing concepts

- Have someone be the point person for each chapter - they will have read and try to understand the exercises prior to the session where everyone works on exercises together (someone would need to prep beforehand to understand a chapter a bit better than everyone else)
