# Contributing Guidelines

## Repo Organization 

- Each section of the book will have its own folder in the repository for people to 
add their own code as they attempt the exercises and quizzes. 

- Naming: name your files with the chapter and your initials (e.g. ch2_rak.qmd) 
so that there aren't issues with people pushing the same file name

- Meeting notes are in their own folder, with the date first (YYYY-MM-DD_meeting_notes.md), and people can edit the meeting notes and push changes - just make sure you fetch the most up to date version of the repo before making any changes (and before pushing back)

- Meeting prep will be posted as in issue with the tag "meeting prep" and the issue will be closed after the meeting. 

## Workflow 

- Since most people will be working in their own scripts, cloning the repo should be fine instead of forking and adding changes via a pull request 

- If you are working in a document that others may also edit, be sure to fetch the repo to make sure your local version is up to date before making any changes, and before pushing, to avoid merge conflicts. You could work on a branch but I don't think that is necessary. 

- If you have changes or ideas to suggest to the structure of the group, create an issue with the label "enhancement" so we know to discuss them at the next meeting 

- We could also do the same thing with questions that come up during the week while working on the exercises - create an issue with the "question" label and we can address that at the meeting.
